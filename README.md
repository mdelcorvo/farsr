# farsr

# Overview

farsr is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package with a set of functions that makes easier to analyze the data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's [Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)](https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars).

# Purpose

The aim of this project was to **combine the skills of creating, writing, and testing an R package**, using the R files provided in the course [Building R Packages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-packages) offered by the Johns Hopkins University through the Coursera's platform.

For this assessment, it was required to perform the following tasks:

1.  Write a vignette to be included in the package using [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html) and [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/);
2.  Formulate at least one test using the [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html) package;
3.  Put the package on Github;
4.  Set up the package's repository so that can be checked and built on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/);
5.  Add the Travis badge to the package's README.md file, as soon as your package has built on Travis and the build is passing without errors, warnings, or notes.
